FROM NOW ON

Lamborghini has unveiled Revuelto, the first HPEV (High
Performance Electrified Vehicle) hybrid super sports car before the
60th anniversary of the marque. With the Revuelto, Lamborghini has
established a new benchmark in terms of performance, on-board
technology and driving pleasure, thanks also to a powertrain that
delivers more than 1000CV in total, combining the power of a brand
new 12-cylinder internal combustion engine with three high density
electric motors and a ground-breaking transversal dual clutch e-
gearbox.
