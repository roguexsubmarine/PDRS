EXPERIMENT NO. 4

[Aim :-To measure tank level using capacitance level probe

Objective

Review various mathods of level measurement
2. Understand working of capacitance love ransmiter

‘Theory: In industry, quids such 2s water, chemicals and solvents are
used in various processes. The amount of such iquid stored can be
found by measuring the love of liquid in a container or a vessel. The
level affects not only the quantity dalvered but also pressure and rate of
flow in and out of the container. Level sensors detect tha level of
substances tke quid, sluries, granular materials and powders. The
substance to be measured can be inside @ container or can be ints
‘natural form. The level measuremant can be ether continuous oF paint
values.

Conclusion :- We have stucied the working of capacitance level probe
‘and various lvel measurement methods through a simulation,
EXPERIMENT NO. 5

[Aim :-To study hardware and sofware associated with PLC

(Objective : 1, Leathe basics and hardware components of PLC
2. Understand configuration of PLC system
2, Study various bung blocks of PLE

Theory : A Programmable Logic Controller, PLC or a Programmable
controler is an electronic device used for automation of industrial
processes, such as control on machinery on factory assembly lines. A
programmable controler is a digitally operating electronic apparatus
Which uses 2 programmable memory for the intemal storage of
instructions for implementing specifc funcions, such a lege,
sequencing, timing, counting and arithmetic to contol various machines
fr processes through digital or analog inputloutput deviees. Unike
‘General purpose computers, the PLC is designed for mule inputs and
outputs, extended temperature ranges, immunity to electrical noise and
resistance to vibrations and impacts.

EXPERIMENT NO. 6

‘Aim :-To understand a simple ladder program

Objective: 1. Develop a ladder using standard procedure
2. Solve the problem using adder programming

‘Theory :- Ladder programming is @ popular language of programming
the PLCS. Ladder diagram shows the sequence ofthe lagi execition
whichis presented diagrammatically. In the ladder diagram. there are
two vertical ines, generally caled phase, positive or neutal. Rungs
which show current lw in horizontal direction are the sequence in which
the logic executes. The Analogous to olay lade has wo main symbole
which are contacts and output coil. Generally each rung has inputs
(contacts) on the left hand side and outputs (col) on the righthand side.
‘These contacts and coils are called as bits ofthe relays. Each mput and
output are individual bits in UO files. An instruction inthe ladder instructs
PLCs how to respond to the bts in UO fles which are stored in the
‘memory. Input contacts are the condtion area, the conditons must be
full to change the status of the ouput cols. Each manufacturer of
PLC systems has their own style of witing the instructons. Different
PLCs have diferent instruction sets but even some common basic
instructions are shared by all the PLCS. All manufacturers give diferent
Software packages for programming PLCs. Ladder is the most
commonly used programming language. Prior to PLCs, relay logic was
sed in industry, Ladders ware daveloped to mimic or imitate relay logic.
Relay Logic / Insructons. A relay isa simple magnetic device which

‘Theory : It's used when an action isto begin a specified time ater the
input becomes tru. Consider an example wherein a certain step inthe
‘manufacturing process is to begin 30 seconds after a signals received
froma limit switch. The 30 seconds delay isthe ON-delay timers preset

EXPERIMENT NO. 8

[Aim :-To develop an application using OF Delay timer

2. Solve the assignment of TOFF timer

‘Theory := Consider an example where the contents of storage tank are
to be transferred to futher process. When the low lovel is detected by
the level eich the aut valve i fo be closed. To alow entire contents
to drain out, some time delay is needed as the level switch is installed
slightly above the tank botom level. This can be achieved by using an
Of dolay timer. Consider an example that, there is @ Low love switch to
tank, and we have to close the dain valve of the tank ater a § second
lay when low lvel is reached. In this case this § seconds delay can
be given using an off delay timer as we have fo cose the dain valve
ser delay

[Aim :-To develop an application using UpiDown counter

Objective: 1. Study counter timing diagram
2. Develop an application specif ladder program using

‘Theory :- Counters are used to count the number of abjacts orto count
cycle ofa typical process. Consider an exampie of a bot filing plat,
in that the counter fs used fo count the number of botles filed in
paricular batch. In counter instucton the accumulated value will
increase only when it competes the transition fom open o close or vice
versa. It dossnit check how long the contact stays closed, it only looks
for the transtion. In the Up counter when contact change over takes
place accumulator value increments by one. Whie in down counter
winen changeover takes place the accumulator value decreases by one.
