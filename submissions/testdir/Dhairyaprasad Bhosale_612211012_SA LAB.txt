Experiment 6: Implementation of Logic gates

Aim: To understand Simple Ladder program
Objectives:

1. Develop a ladder using standard procedure.

2. Solve the problem using ladder programming.
Procedure:

1. Prior to starting of the development of ladder diagram following
steps needs to be understood:

a. Understand the problem statement like test the logic for

OR gate, AND Gate etc.

b. Develop the logic on paper and validate the logic by

considering various cases

c. Prepare the truth table and test the logic using all valid

cases

d, Go to simulator icon and click on the "Simulator" button

e. The PLC simulator will be opened in new window
2. The procedure for writing the ladder diagram in the work space
is as follows

a. The screen shot for the first window will appear like this.
Glick this icon to add new rung,

“These instructions are available for develop!
and these are rogram mode on!

\

The active rung will be indicated by blue line on the left
aide of the rung.

b. Place the contacts as per the requirement by clicking the

appropriate contact shown in the left pan of the window. In
the example demonstrated below one normally contact and

‘one coil is placed as shown the figure.

c. Double Click on the contact or coil and you can give tag
name like "start", "stop" etc. Please ensure that the tag
numbers are true replica of process connections. Similarly
give tag name to coil like "motor", "Lamp" etc. The final

ladder will look like this.

d. Please note that the tag names are case sensitive and if you

are using them in circuit as bit make sure that the correct

tag name appears.

e. Click the Run button available at the left side of the window
so the ladder will be ready for running and you can test

your logic. Both sides of the rung will become green and

this is the indication of run mode. Please not that in run

mode the contact is not available so if you want to make

changes you will have to go in design/program mode.
f. Double click on the contact and the window for toggling
the contact will appear. As you press toggle the state of
contact will change. Hence the output contact status will

change.

If you place the cursor on the contact the status
will be shown (In this case start has 1 state means
the contact is energsed)

g. Please remember the ladder contacts or the state of the
inputs and outputs are always in de-energised state. The
de-energised is that state wherein the contacts are in non-
active state.

h. You can once again toggle the contact and the output state
will change. To add any contact, you will have to go in
programme mode. Click on the rung and add contacts.

i. To delete any contact or output click on the contact green
line below the contact will appear press "delete" the

contact will be deleted.
j. To reload the ladder, right click the mouse "Reload "button
will appear and after pressing the button the page will be
ready for new ladder development.

k. You can add seven elements in series and 5 elements in
parallel.

|. To add element in parallel click on the contact where you
wish to add parallel branch, Select the branch and drag it to
location where you wish to terminate the branch. The

screen will appear as shown below.

m. Repeat the procedure and check the correctness of the
logic.
n, Similarly, you can check the logic for OR, NOR, and NAND

gates. Validate the truth tables and confirm the results.

Conclusion:
We have studied logic gates, Boolean values and
constructed and tested different types of logic gates using ladder

programming.
Experiment 7: Develop an application using On-Delay timer

Aim: To develop an application using On-Delay timer.
Objectives:

1. Study the timing diagram of On Delay Timer

2. Solve the assignment of Ton timer
Procedure:

In this experiment the on-delay timer will be tested for its
functionalities using Simulator. Following bits of the timer are to be
observed.

¢ Initialising bit "q" in this case.

© Enable bit "EN"

@ Done bit "DN"

© Timer timing bit "TT"

Preset value needs to be entered by the user.

To reset the counter use "Reset" command so that the counter can be
configured for new counts without reloading the page. Please note the
tag of the reset bit must be the tag of counter e.g."CU1". The screen
shot will appear as shown below.

While configuring the timer the time base needs to be selected. There
are two options viz. 1 mS and 10 mS are available for you to configure.
Select appropriate as per the need of the application. The screen shot

of the configured timer will appear like this.
To test the EN, DN, and TT bits; double click on the bit and give tag

name to the bit. The same tag name is to be used in the new rung to
test the status or to energies the output. You can also test the
cascading of the timer using these bits. For details see following screen
shots. Observe the tag name for timer DN bit in Edit Mode and how it
is used in the logic.

Observe the bit status in Run mode when input a is toggled.

See following screen shot to observe the output bit status when delay

is over.

To reset the DN counter use "Reset" command so that the counter can
be configured for new counts without reloading the page. Please note

the tag of the reset bit must be the tag of counter e.g. "CD1".

Observation:

Conclusion:
ON-delay timer circuits are not activated until after a certain amount
of time (preset) has elapsed. They are used to control the timing of

conveyor belts and other equipment.
Experiment 8: Develop an application using OFF Delay Timer
Aim: To Develop an application using OFF Delay Timer

Objectives:

1. Study the timing diagram of OFF Delay Timer

2. Solve the assignment of Toff timer
Procedure:

The configuration of off delay timer is same as ‘on delay timer’.
Atypical difference can be observed in the operation (in Run mode).
When the q bit is energised the output DN bit goes high. The timer
starts only after toggling the

isation bit again.

To test the EN, DN, and TT bits; double click on the bit and give tag

name to the bit. The same tag name is to be used in the new rung to
test the status or to energies the output. You can also test the

cascading of the timer using these bits.

Observation:

Conclusion:

OFF-delay timers open or close the circuit as soon as power is
removed. The contacts will not return to their normal position until
the preset time delay has elapsed. They are used in air-conditioning

systems, elevator doors, etc.
Experiment 9: Develop an application using UP/DOWN
counter
Aim: To Develop an application using UP/DOWN counter
Objectives:
1. Study Counter timing diagram.

2. Develop an application specific ladder program using counters.
Procedure:

Implement the counter using Simulator
The counter counts the pulses received at input. The pulses can be
given by toggling the input bit "q" in this case. The counter will keep
on counting till it reaches the preset value set by the user. Once the
accumulator is equal to preset the DN bit will be energised. After this
instant if next pulse is detected, the accumulator will increment
without changing the status of DN bit.

To reset the counter use "Reset" command so that the counter can be
configured for new counts without reloading the page. Please note the
tag of the reset bit must be the tag of counter e.g., "U1". The screen

shot will appear as shown below.

Vic neem eT

In case of down counter, the entire procedure will remain same. Only
the number of counts is to be entered in the accumulator tab. The
preset value is zero. When the input contact closes, the accumulator
will go on decrementing, will reach to zero '0' value and the status of
done bit will change. To reset the DN counter use "Reset" command so
that the counter can be configured for new counts without reloading
the page. Please note the tag of the reset bit must be the tag of counter
e.g.,"CD1".

Observation:

UP counter

DOWN counter

Conclusion:
Up counter counts from zero to the maximum number of counts. Down

counter counts from the maximum value to zero value.
