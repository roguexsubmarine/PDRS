Experiment 1: Characterize the Temperature Sensor (RTD)

Objectives:

4. Aim: To understand the working principle of RTD
Study static and dynamic characteristics of RTD

2. Study effect of various parameters on RTD performance

Procedure:

Part 2: Static charactristis
1 Select the material of RTD you want to use. Temperature

coefficient (a) forthe same will be displayed on the screen. Note
this value,

2. Click on RO' to get the value of RO for selected RTD. Note the

3. Clickon ‘Get Temp’. The temperature for which Rts tobe found
willbe displayed.

4. Using formula calculate the value of Rt and enter the answer in
the box provided (up to2 decimals with rounding of) Submit

the answer using submit button

5. If our calculation is correct, goto step 3. Repeat the procedure
min 3 times.

6.1f your calculation is wrong, you willbe asked to repeat the same.
Please refer to GET FORMULA tab and verify your calculations
7.Afte finishing minimum 3 set of correct readings, you can see
the graph by clicking on Plat’

{8 When the graph is displayed click Next tab to repeat the
procedure with different reference resistance(R0) value and
with elifferent materials,

9. Minimum 3 calculations are necessary to pt the graph.
10, Study the graphs for RTD performance with different
reference resistance values and different materials

Part 2: Dynamic Characteristics
1 Select the RTD as bare element (make ton). Wit the standard
dimensions considered for bare element, the time constant value
will gt displayed in the output box. Verify this by using equation
given under Get formula tab
2. Now select the RTD dynamic performance with sheath. Select
‘appropriate material and thickness value. The time constant
value wil get displayed inthe output box. Verity this by using
‘equation given under formula tab
3. Observe the change in the time constant values with diferent
materials with different thickness.

4. Now select the RTD dynamic performance with thermowell
Select appropriate material thickness an filing material. The
time constant value wll get displayed in the output box when
‘thermowell material, thickness and filing material is selected.
‘Verify tis by using equation given under formula ta,

5. Observe the change inthe time constant values with different
materials with differen thickness, Also see the effect of change

in filing material,
6. Click on plot button to observe the dynamic response (Time Vs
Temperature)
7. Observe and verify response time of RTD whichis generally S
times the time constant value,

observation:

1. Resistance of RFD probe depends onthe temperature and
material as diferent materi haveaferent values of
temperature coeflens

2. The value of te constant creases when RTD placed inside a

‘heath and tinereases further when paced esse a thermowel
